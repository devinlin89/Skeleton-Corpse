        <p>
            Welcome to Skeleton Corpse! We're thrilled to have you here .
            In this inaugural blog post, we want to introduce myself and
            provide a glimpse of what you can expect from our website.
        </p>

        <h2>My Reason For Starting This</h2>
        <p>
            I want a platform where I can share my thoughts with people.
            Without censorship or repercussions. I want to share my true
            and raw opinions about the things that I'm interested in.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    I of course aspire to become a software engineer in the future.
                    I made this website as a way to experiment with Web Dev.
                    I want to share programming news and the such on this platform.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Formula 1</h3>
                <p>
                    I absolutely love Formula 1. The cars and the drivers, I love them both all.
                    If you know me, you probably know that I'm a fan of Yuki Tsunoda.
                    I absolutely adore him, so you will find some content related to him here.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cycling</h3>
                <p>
                    Cycling is something I enjoy doing when I get the chance.
                    I don't cycle often, but I cherish every second I am on my bike.
                    I love my bike very much, I cried when I scratched it.
                    So if you see any cycling-related posts, it's because they are coming straight from my heart.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>School Stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course I'm still a student, so I will be talking about the events at my school.
                    It may be about Student Council Elections, my take on new rules, etc.
                    It's always good to keep up-to-date with what's happening there.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Other</h3>
                <p>
                    Naturally, my interests are up bound to change.
                    The topics that I will be covering are not set in stone and will change over time.
                    This blog is for fun after all so I don't have to keep everything consistent.
                    I just hope you guys enjoy reading this.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So now that I have gotten everything out of the way,
            I just hope you and I have fun during the operation of this blog.
            I think I will be covering the Brazil GP tomorrow, so stay tuned!
