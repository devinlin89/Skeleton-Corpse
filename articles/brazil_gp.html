        <h2>Shocking Race</h2>
        <p>
            The Brazilian Sao Paulo GP was one hell of a race!
            Even before the race actually started, Charles Leclerc
            crashed into the barriers during the formation lap due
            to a hydraulics issue. At the race start,
            Albon and Magnussen collided and crashed into
            the barrier at turn 1, causing damage to several
            other cars and triggering a red flag.
        </p>
        <p>
            In spite of all the chaos, it was a good day for Verstappen and Norris,
            both fighting for the lead and with a considerable gap behind them.
            It was Verstappen that (obviously) won the race.
        </p>

        <h2>Mercedes' Catastrophe</h2>
        <p>
            However, who did not have a good day was definitely Mercedes.
            It was heated between the 2 drivers, with Russel complaining
            about their lack of teamwork when he got passed by Perez.
            Despite Mercedes' valiant efforts to attempt an undercut,
            Russell retired and Hamilton was passed by Perez then Sainz anyways.
        </p>

        <h2>Yuki Tsunoda's Comeback</h2>
        <p>
            Yuki Tsunoda had one of the best races of the season.
            From a terrible qualifying landing him P16 on the grid.
            On the other hand, he managed to qualify and finish P6 in the sprint.
            However, the main race wasn't a disappointment either.
            At the start, he managed to get up there and fight his way through the field,
            landing him P10 right before the red flag.
            His performance was amazing, even taking on faster cars.
            This let him finish P9 in the points, 7 places up the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sao Paulo GP was one of the more exciting races in this "boring" season.
            Not only because of the crashes but also because of the great performances from some teams,
            like AlphaTauri and Alpine.
            Hopefully we can see more of this during the Las Vegas GP!
